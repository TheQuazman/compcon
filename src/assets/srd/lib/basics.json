      "en": "<p>There are three types of dice rolls in Lancer: <strong>skill checks</strong>, <strong>attacks</strong>, and <strong>saves</strong>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In narrative play, you will only need to worry about the first of these. In mech combat you will use all three.&nbsp;</p> <p>You make <strong>skill checks</strong> when your character is in a challenging or tense situation that requires effort to overcome. When you want to act in such a situation, state your objective (e.g., break down the door, decrypt the data, or sweet-talk the guard), then roll <strong>1d20</strong>, and add any relevant bonuses. On a total of <strong>10+</strong>, you succeed. A result of<strong>&nbsp;9 or less</strong> means you failed to accomplish your goal and may suffer consequences as a result. Although the GM can&rsquo;t change the target number (<strong>10</strong>), they have access to several tools that are explained later (p. 45-47), such as declaring a skill challenge or deciding that your action is <strong>DIFFICULT </strong>or <strong>RISKY</strong>.&nbsp;</p> <p>In mech combat, <strong>attacks </strong>are any offensive actions against other characters, like firing a weapon or hacking into an opponent&rsquo;s mech. Attack rolls are similar to skill checks &ndash; you roll <strong>1d20</strong> and add any bonuses &ndash; but the target number isn&rsquo;t always <strong>10</strong>, and usually depends on the defensive capabilities of your target. For an attack to be successful it needs to equal or exceed the target&rsquo;s defense. Successful attacks are described as &ldquo;<strong>hits</strong>&rdquo; - so if the rules tell you that an effect happens &ldquo;<strong>on hit</strong>&rdquo;, that means it takes place when you make a successful attack. Some attacks also result in <strong>critical hits</strong>. On a roll of <strong>20+</strong> you perform a critical hit, which allows you to deal more damage or sometimes trigger extra effects.&nbsp;</p> <p>Although there are different types of attacks, including ranged, melee, and tech attacks, they all use the same basic rules described here.&nbsp;</p> <p>Lastly, <strong>saves </strong>are rolls made to avoid or resist negative effects in mech combat. You might roll a save to prevent a hacker wrecking your systems, to avoid being blinded by a flash grenade, or to dive away from an explosion. To save, you roll <strong>1d20</strong> and add any bonuses, but the target number can differ from <strong>10 </strong>as it can with attacks. The target number for a save usually depends on the abilities of the attacker. If you equal or exceed this number, you succeed; if your roll is lower, you fail. The outcome of each result will depend on what you are trying to avoid.</p>"

Your <strong>LL&nbsp;</strong>applies to both your pilot and your mech &ndash; as you level up, both parts of your character become stronger and gain access to more advanced gear and combat techniques. Increasing it allows you to unlock new manufacturer licenses, opening the door to exclusive gear and mechs.

This is called a scene because it&rsquo;s helpful to think about it in cinematic terms: as long as the focus (or &lsquo;camera&rsquo;) is on the players and their action, a scene is happening.
